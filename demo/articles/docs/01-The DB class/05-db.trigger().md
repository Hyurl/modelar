### db.trigger()

*Fires an event and triggers its handlers.*

**parameters:**

- `event` The event name.
- `args`  Arguments passed to event handlers.

**return:**

Returns the current instance for function chaining.

This method allows you fire an user-defined event and its handlers, but be 
aware, you must call it in a class method which the class extends `DB` or one 
of its subclasses. If you call it outside the class, unexpected errors may 
occur.
