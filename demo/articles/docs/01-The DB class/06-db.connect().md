### db.connect()

*Makes a connection to the database. This method will automatically check the* 
*pool, if there are connections available in the pool, the first one will be* 
*retrieved; if no connections are available, a new one will be established.*

**return:**

Returns a Promise, and the the only argument passed to the callback of 
`then()` is the current instance.

```javascript
const DB = require("modelar/DB");

var db = new DB("./modelar.db");
db.connect().then(db=>{
    //Do stuffs here...
}).catch(err=>{
    console.log(err);
});
```

Normally, you don't have to make connection by manually calling this method,
when the [db.query()](#dbquery) is called, the connection will be established 
automatically.
