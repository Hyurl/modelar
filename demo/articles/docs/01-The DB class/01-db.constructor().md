### db.constructor()

*Creates a new instance with specified configurations.*

**parameters:**

- `[config]` An object that carries configurations for the current instance, 
    or a string that sets only the database name.

```javascript
var db = new DB({
    database: "./modelar.db",
});

//Also, you can pass a string to the constructor, it will be treated as the 
//database name for configuration, like this:
var db = new DB("./modelar.db"); //This is the same as above.
```

All supported configurations are:

- `type` Sets the database type (default: `mysql`).
- `database` Sets the database name that needs to open.
- `host` Sets the serve name of the database (MySQL only, default: 
    `localhost`).
- `port` Sets the server port (MySQL only, default: `3306`);
- `user` Sets the username that used to log in (MySQL only, default: `root`).
- `password` Sets the password of the user (MySQL only).
- `charset` Sets the charset (MySQL only, default: `utf8`).
- `timeout` Sets both the connection timeout and query timeout(MySQL only, 
    default is `5000` misc.).

When a instance is created, the connection to the database is not yet 
established. The connection will be established when you call 
[db.connect()](#dbconnect) or implicitly opened by calling 
[db.query()](#dbquery).

You don't need to worry that every time you instantiate a DB or its 
subclasses like Query or Model, even subclasses of Model and so on, a new 
connection will be established, well, there will be not.

DB class provides an internal pool for connections, when a connection has 
done its job, it could be recycled and retrieved, there for saving the 
resources and speeding up the program.

Also, DB class saves connections by there specifications, so you don't need to
worry that they will mess up in the connection pool.
