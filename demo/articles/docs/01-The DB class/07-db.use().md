### db.use()

*Uses a DB instance and share its connection to the database.*

**parameters:**

- `db` A DB instance that is already created.

**return:**

Returns the current instance for function chaining.

```javascript
const DB = reuiqre("modelar/DB");

var db = new DB("./modelar.db");
db.connect().then(db=>{
    var db2 = new DB("./modelar.db");
    db2.use(db); //Now db2 shares the same connection with db.
});
```

This method is meant to share connections between DB instances, so that when 
you create a new instance, you can use a connection that is already 
established instead of creating a new one, there for saving resources and 
speeding up the program. Remember if you use this method, **call it right** 
**after creating the instance.**
